# Disease-diagnosis-bot
A disease prediction bot that uses machine learning to predict diseases based on user-input symptoms.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning). It contains various symptoms and their corresponding diseases.

## Files
- **bot.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the disease prediction bot.
- **training.csv**: CSV file containing the training dataset.
- **testing.csv**: CSV file containing the testing dataset.

## Usage
To use the disease prediction bot, run the `bot.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions. The bot will ask for symptoms as input and predict the possible disease based on the input.

## Future Scope
In the future, I plan to build a user interface for the bot to make it more user-friendly and accessible to a wider audience.
